= TowerGame

== Synopsis

My take at a homebrew Nintendo DS game using libnds: crawl aimlessly in an infinite randomly
generated dungeon.

== Requirements

You can check wikipedia to see how to install a homebrew game on your
nds:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_homebrew

To build the game, devkitPRO and libnds are required.
Follow these instructions to install them:
http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM

== Installation

		cd tower_game
		make

Then copy the file tower_game.nds to your slot-1 device.

== TODO

* Add some ennemies
* Add objects, inventory
* ...

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

Let me know if you want to work on this game. I kind of lost motivation
to keep developping it alone, but if someone would like to team up I'd
love to continue.
